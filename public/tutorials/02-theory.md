- How thoroughly do you evaluate your training programs?
- How do you ensure your training is effective when teachers return to their roles?
- If they struggle to apply what they've learned, how can you support them?
- Ultimately, how can you prove that your training positively impacts the field?

## Understanding Evaluation Models

To answer these questions, you need to assess various evaluation levels throughout the training sessions and beyond, not just participants' satisfaction immediately after a session. The Kirkpatrick model is a widely recognized framework that focuses on four of these levels: reaction, learning, behavior, and results.

Another researcher, Guskey, later adapted this model for education. These models offer a comprehensive and longitudinal view of training effectiveness and provide insights needed to make informed improvements.

## The Challenge

However, such evaluation models are often neglected. Most assessments focus solely on immediate participant satisfaction due to the time and effort required to collect data and a lack of dedicated tools. For instance, in the corporate world, 20% of companies don't evaluate training at all, while 80% only measure satisfaction. Meanwhile, executives indicate that business leaders see the lack of concrete measures as a recurring challenge, weakening the effectiveness of their training programs. In education, similar trends exist; studies show that most assessments focus only on participant perceptions and satisfaction while neglecting learning and practical application.

This gap underscores the importance of a robust and ongoing evaluation process that captures training effectiveness on multiple levels.

## Our Solution

To provide the necessary information, we've developed this web application using a revised version of Guskey's model. Our model includes nine levels that help you organize and collect the right information quickly, from training sessions to the concrete results achieved by teachers in the field. It gives you the ability to gather accurate data to support teachers when applying their training in real-world scenarios and helps you collect crucial information to continuously improve your training programs.

For each level, specific indicators need to be measured, reflecting those typically found to influence the subsequent levels. The application offers standard indicators for certain levels. These indicators are not exhaustive and can be adjusted to your specific training conditions and needs.
